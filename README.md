# ray-tracer-challenge-java
Raytracer implementation following the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge".

Making this public in case the code might be a helpful example for someone.

> Note: This project has been moved to JDK 16 because a) JDK 16 is the current release as of a week ago, and b) I intend to try using the preview Vector API to optimize some of the operations of the raytracer.
